            <h2>About Me</h2>
              <p>I'm currently a fourth year undergraduate CS student at IIT who enjoys
                website and application development. In my spare time, I rotate around a few different hobbies
                which include photography, graphic design, reading, and calligraphy.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
              <p>I throughly enjoy being able to think of an idea, go through the entire design process,
                and then fully develop an application or website. Therefore, once graduating, I'm looking
                forward to working full time as a developer of some type.</p>
